– fetal growth tape measure
– fetal heart rate
– clinician/midwife checks (what are they looking for when they palpate for example)
– ultrasound (brief text, link to ultrasound page which as it’s a key thing we can visualise/role of models/useful for clinicans to use as an explainer in clinic I think should also link from home page as below)
– Personalised assessment of pregnancy (customised growth centiles) (it would actually be really cool if people could interactively plot/enter their own growth chart information in here using the customised growth centiles)
